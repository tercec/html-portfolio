<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Terenc Lekaj, an experienced ESL teacher with over 7 years of helping students improve their English communication skills, 
  especially in business settings. 
  Recently, I’ve taken a new and exciting direction—
  I'm currently studying to become a full-stack web developer through Angela Yu’s Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp.</p>

<p>My goal is to transition into tech and combine my background in education with modern web development skills to create useful, user-friendly websites and apps. 
  I'm passionate about learning, problem-solving, and building things that make life easier and more engaging.</p>

<p>As I continue growing in this field, I’m open to freelance opportunities, collaborations, or internships where I can apply my new skills, learn from real-world projects, and contribute to meaningful digital solutions. 
  I'm especially interested in clean design, responsive layouts, and user-focused experiences..</p>
