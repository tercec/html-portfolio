    <h2>My top 3 movies </h2>
    <hr />
<h3>The secret life of Valter Mitty</h3>
<p>Subtle,emotional,deep,makes you think about what is really important in life</p>
<h3>The intouchables</h3>
<p>I have to start this paragraph by saying i enjoy the original french version.This is a great mix of comedy and drama.It shows the differences,distinctions and contrasts of two different worlds,poor and rich.But it also shows that rich can be also vulnerable,weak,and unprotected towards life's insecurities</p>
<h3>Top Gun Maverick</h3>
<p>Maybe I am affected by the affection and liking I have for Tom Cruise as an actor,but this was a really great action movie</p>
<h3>Pro bonus-Fav all time Tv Series</h3>
<p>I can mention here:Dr House,Jack Ryan</p>
